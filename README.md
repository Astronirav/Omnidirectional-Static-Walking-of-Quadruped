# Omnidirectional-Static-Walking-of-Quadruped
In this code, motion planning of Omnidirectional Static Walking of Quadruped is explored. 
The algorithm implemented here minimizes the time taken for transition between different gaits. 
Visulization of Motion Planning Algorithm is made by stick model of Quadruped.
The algorithm implemented here is described in this paper: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1416967/
